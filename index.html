    <h2>About me</h2>
    <h3>Former Digital Marketing professional turned Web Developer</h3>
    <p>
      Think back to the first time you completed your first
      <em>LEGO</em> project or when you figured out how to add a window to your
      basic <em>Lincoln Logs</em> square cabin. How did you feel? I still feel
      that excitement whenever a coding project comes together just the way you
      planned it. I've always had an inquisitive nature and the feeling of awe
      and wonder after discovering something new is incredible. One that I want
      to share with the rest of the world. Exciting things are comingâ€¦ stay
      tuned!
