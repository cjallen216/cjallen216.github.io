    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Former Digital Marketing professional turned Web Developer</p>
    <p>
      Think back to the first time you completed your first LEGO project or when
      you figured out how to add a window to your basic Lincoln Logs square
      cabin. How did you feel? I still feel that excitement whenever a coding
      project comes together just the way you planned it. I've always had an
      inquisitive nature and the feeling of awe and wonder after discovering
      something new is incredible. One that I want to share with the rest of the
      world. Exciting things are comingâ€¦ stay tuned!
