                But where'd he go, the seagull? Right to that sliding wave to
                pick that seahorse up again, and mock my efforts brave!
              </p>
              <p>
                “Oh, no you don't!” I shouted as I threw another shell, and when
                it landed Mr. Gull let out a mighty yell.
              </p>
              <p>
                Again he dropped the tiny horse and slowly backed away. He knew
                that I meant business, that I wasn't there to play.
              </p>
              <p>
                This time when I took little horse I walked into the waves. I
                walked out, far as I could go, to make sure he was saved.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lowered gently 'neath the surf, I watched him swim away... I
                miss him still, that precious horse. he'd surely made my day.

                  Have you ever seen a seahorse, swimming in the sea? The one I
                  saw was tiny, as small as he could be.
                </p>
                <p>
                  His bones were on the outside and his tail was curling in. He
                  could hook it o'er a seaweed blade and stand there on a whim.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I saw this tiny seahorse, but he wasn't in the water! I saw
                  him in a seagull's beak, just where he shouldn't ought'er!
                </p>
                <p>
                  I shied a seashell at the gull which made him drop his prey.
                  and then I ran to get it, yelling, “Gull! you keep away!”
                </p>
                <p>
                  I held it oh, so gently, and I saw its soft round tummy. Its
                  heart was beating crazily; I didn't think it funny.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The seagull did; he laughed out loud! I wondered what to do. I
                  placed the horse down in the surf, at which the seagull flew.
