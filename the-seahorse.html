            Have You Ever Seen A Seahorse, Swimming In The Sea?
            The One I Saw Was Tiny, As Small As He Could Be.
          </p>
          <p>
            His Bones Were On The Outside And His Tail Was Curling In.
            He Could Hook It O'er A Seaweed Blade And Stand There On A Whim.
          </p>
          <p>
            I Saw This Tiny Seahorse,  But He Wasn't In The Water!
            I Saw Him In A Seagull's Beak, Just Where He Shouldn't Ought'er!
          </p>
          <p>
            I Shied A Seashell At The Gull Which Made Him Drop His Prey.
            And Then I Ran To Get It,  Yelling, “Gull! You Keep Away!”
          </p>
          <p>
            I Held It Oh, So Gently, And I Saw Its  Soft Round Tummy.
            Its Heart Was Beating Crazily; I Didn't Think It Funny.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Seagull Did; He Laughed Out Loud! I Wondered What To Do.
            I Placed The Horse Down In The Surf, At Which The Seagull Flew.
          </p>
          <p>
            But Where'd He Go, The Seagull? Right To That Sliding Wave
            To Pick That Seahorse Up Again, And Mock My Efforts Brave!
          </p>
          <p>
            “Oh, No You Don't!” I Shouted As I Threw Another Shell,
            And When It Landed Mr. Gull Let Out A Mighty Yell.
          </p>
          <p>
            Again He Dropped The Tiny Horse And Slowly Backed Away.
            He Knew That I Meant Business, That I Wasn't There To Play.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Time When I Took Little Horse I Walked Into The Waves.
            I Walked Out, Far As I Could Go, To Make Sure He Was Saved.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lowered Gently 'neath The Surf, I Watched Him Swim Away....
            I Miss Him Still, That Precious Horse.  He'd Surely Made My Day.

                </p>
                <p>
                  Again he dropped the tiny horse and slowly backed away. He knew
                  that I meant business, that I wasn't there to play.

                    Have you ever seen a seahorse, swimming in the sea? The one I
                    saw was tiny, as small as he could be.
                  </p>

                    His bones were on the outside and his tail was curling in. He
                    could hook it o'er a seaweed blade and stand there on a whim.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I saw this tiny seahorse, but he wasn't in the water! I saw
                    him in a seagull's beak, just where he shouldn't ought'er!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I shied a seashell at the gull which made him drop his prey.

                    I held it oh, so gently, and I saw its soft round tummy. Its
                    heart was beating crazily; I didn't think it funny.

                  <p>
                    The seagull did; he laughed out loud! I wondered what to do. I
                    placed the horse down in the surf, at which the seagull flew.
