                And look at us now, we're almost bare bones! but I've an idea!
                we'll call in the gnomes! they'll dress you up fancy, if just for
                a day, and we will have fun being part of the play!”
              </p>
              <p>
                So they called in their friends with their brushes and paints they
                were even rewarded with angels and saints! The elm and the maple,
                the sumac and oak shook off their leaves like shedding a cloak.
                the shapes were so different, the colors were too, and the kind
                little sumac gave candles like new.
              </p>
              <p>
                Last came an angel with stars for the lights, with the prettiest one for the top – what a sight!
                thus, in the mountains faraway where winters were long and short
                the day appeared the first symbol we long to see: a gift of love... The Christmas Tree

                  Once in mountains faraway where winters were long and short the
                  day lived trees of all kinds with leaves they shed, which turned
                  to orange and brown and red.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Except for the one, rich green all year except for the one that
                  dropped a tear!
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Oh, why can't I be like the others?” she sobbed, “What's wrong
                  with me, that I've been robbed of colors in autumn, so pretty,
                  so bright! no leaves for me; just needles tight.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “That's no way to feel,” smiled the oak from afar. “You're
                  beautiful, deary, just as you are! green is so restful a color,
                  you know, why, we're all green in summer, just not in the snow.
